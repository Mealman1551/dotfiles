## What is it?

**Gnome-Corer** is a debloating script for Debian's bloated environment that will bring GNOME to a GNOME-Core level.

For now this only works for Debian 12 (Bookworm/Stable), Sid and Testing (Trixie) have some problems, but it will be fixed!

---

## For which distro is it made?

Gnome-Corer is written for **Debian**.

---

## For which Debian version is this?

Currently, this works on **Debian 12.11**. I will update with every Debian update.

---

## How to Use

1. Download the script from the latest release:
   [Download Gnome-Corer](https://github.com/Mealman1551/Gnome-Corer/releases/download/1.1.0/gnome-corer.sh)

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x gnome-corer.sh

3. Run the script with root privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo ./gnome-corer.sh

And you're done! Your GNOME environment will now be debloated to a GNOME-Core level.

---

## How is it tested?

I use Debian {Version} in a Virtual Machine to test the removal of packages.
