# Welcome to the Project!

## Contributing to the Project

This document will help you contribute to the ADC project.

You can contribute to ADC by cloning the Canary repository and modifying the feature or fix you want to work on.

## Steps to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/Mealman1551/adc-canary.git
    ```
3. **Modify the code**: Modify or fix the code you want to work on.
4. **Commit your changes**: After making your changes, commit them with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```
5. **Push your changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
6. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and create a pull request from your forked repository. Provide a clear description of the changes you made and why they are necessary.
7. **Review and Feedback**: The project maintainers will review your pull request. Be open to feedback and make necessary changes if requested.

important to know: A maintainer will look at teh blame and diff to see what you changed, so make sure to only change the lines you need to change. After that the changes will be manually implemented. This is because the source code is updated very frequently and we want to avoid merge conflicts.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the project.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Ensure your code is well-documented with comments where necessary.
- Run tests to ensure your changes do not break existing functionality.

## Reporting Issues

ADC Canary doesnt use issues as it is a constantly developing project.

## 100th commit

If you have reached 25 clear and valid commits, you will be given a PAT (Personal Access Token) to directly push to the main branch. This is a reward for your contributions and trust in the project. The PAT is restricted to only commit and push.

The PAT will be send to you via email, so make sure to provide a valid email address when you reach this milestone.

The PAT is restricted to only commit and push to the main branch of the ADC Canary repository. It cannot be used for any other actions or repositories.

If the PAT is misused or abused, it will be revoked immediately and you will lose the privilege to push directly to the main branch.

If the PAT is lost or forgotten, you can request a new one by reaching out to me.

## Can i still contribute to the main Stable and Aurora branch?

No. The main branches on GitHub (Stable and Aurora) are closed for contributions since 6.7.2025, we want you to contribute to the Canary branch only. This is because the main branches are stable and we want to keep them that way. The Canary branch is where we experiment with new features and fixes, so it is the best place for you to contribute.
